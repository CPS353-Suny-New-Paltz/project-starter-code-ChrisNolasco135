# Software Engineering Project Starter Code

This repository will start you off with an initial configuration that you'll modify as part of Checkpoint 1. As part of the modifications, you'll eventually delete the contents of this README and replace it with documentation for your project.

Checkpoint 2
This system will receive an numerical input and decode the input utilizing Caesar's Cipher with a shift of 7, if given an input of 0124050508001608110523, it will result in Hello World 

Checkpoint 6
The upper bound for the number of threads to be utilized is a maximum of 4 threads. This is to ensure that the system does not become overloaded with too many threads, which could lead to performance degradation. The system will dynamically allocate threads based on the workload, but will never exceed the maximum limit of 4 threads.
